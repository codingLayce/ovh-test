# Technical test for OVH

In this repository, you will find my answers for the two exercises.

My answers contain a pseudo-code part and an explanation part.

Concerning the pseudo-code part, I am not used to write pseudo-code, so I have tried my best. 

I used a C like syntax because it's the one I am the most comfortable with. I concider the pseudo-code not strongly typed, and the conversions are handled by the language (such as numbers in string converted to int automatically). I have made other assumptions on built-in features, but I notify them in comments or in the explanation part.

- Exercise 1: [IP Region](ip-region.md)
- Exercise 2: [HTTPS & DNS](https-and-dns.md)
